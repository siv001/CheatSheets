1.We should have to receive alerts on stuck threads as soon as it gets stuck. This could be achievable using WLST/WLDF inbuilt feature in weblogic. See the attached generated email for your reference.( /mailtester/inputproxy is taking longer time to respond)
2.SLA alerts need to be configured on OSB business services to find out the bottlenecks, i.e. If any business service which is taking long time to respond due to external system slowness, This feature will gives the alert on particular business service, so that we can find out the root cause which we could not get in server logs or any thread dumps. See the attached generated email for your reference.
(BusinessService$mailtester$inputbs)
3.We need to configure the particular node in such a way that whenever 400+ threads were stuck and server is not responding, This particular node in that cluster should get restarted automatically without any manual intervention.(ofcourse before it dies, it will generates thread dump for threads analysis). Thus we can avoid the delay of restarting this node with all approvals.
